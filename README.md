# Gyroid Stress Optimization
This is a independent study aimed at optimizing a functionally-graded gyroid based on the stress gradient. The research in this project builds on work done at the University of Pittsburgh by Hao Deng & Albert C. To. The current work modifies their method to optimize based on stress over a continuous density function.
